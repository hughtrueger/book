<h1>Use {} Instead of New Object()</h1>

There are multiple ways to create objects in JavaScript. Perhaps the more traditional method is to use the "new" constructor, like so:

var o = new Object();
o.name = 'Jeffrey';
o.lastName = 'Way';
o.someFunction = function() {
   console.log(this.name);
}

However, this method receives the "bad practice" stamp without actually being so. Instead, I recommend that you use the much more robust object literal method.

Better

var o = {
   name: 'Jeffrey',
   lastName = 'Way',
   someFunction : function() {
      console.log(this.name);
   }
};
Note that if you simply want to create an empty object, {} will do the trick.
